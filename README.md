# arduino-wavetable-synth

Arduino sketch that implements a simple wavetable synthesizer.

## Summary

This sketch produces an audio synthesizer that outputs various types of waveforms. The waveform is generated using simple wavetable synthesis techniques. Frequency of the waveform can be controlled by varying voltage to an input pin on the Arduino. The resulting output signal is sent to an output pin as a PWM signal.
